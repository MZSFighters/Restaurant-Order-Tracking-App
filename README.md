## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_

This project was a university project for Computer Science. We had to develop a Mobile App as part of our academic modules. It was meant to be worked on for a few months only and the database of the application was held on the university's servers. Hence, this project is no longer worked on and most of it is no longer functional, especially after the database had been removed from the servers.
